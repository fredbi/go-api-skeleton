// Iface is the interface that provides the application context.
//
// This context contains the state that is global to an application instance.
// It provides insulation, so that multiple contexts can actually run in parallel in the same process
//
// Typical extensions of this app environment are: healthcheck instrumentation, authentication & authorization tooling,
// API clients used to process incoming requests, etc.
